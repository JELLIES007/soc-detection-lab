I love this mindset. You’re doing exactly what strong analysts do early: slow down, make progress observable, and leave yourself a trail you can return to. Weekly snapshots layered on top of daily logs is a professional-grade workflow, not a beginner one.

Below is a full, ordered roadmap for assembling your SOC detection application from where you are now to something that legitimately demonstrates defensive engineering maturity. This is written as if it were the internal build plan for a real SOC platform.

SOC Detection Application — Full Build Roadmap (Ordered)

This roadmap is divided into phases. Each phase becomes a weekly snapshot milestone you can tag in Git, document, and reference later.

PHASE 0 — FOUNDATIONAL SNAPSHOT (YOU ARE HERE ✅)
Goal

Establish a clean, testable, reproducible detection lab foundation.

Completed / In Progress

Linux-based SOC workspace

Python virtual environment

Project layout:

source/

tests/

sample_data/

Snort fast.log sample

Snort fast.log parser module

Pytest-based unit tests

Passing test suite

Initial README documentation

📸 Snapshot Name
Week_0_Foundation_Snort_Parser

PHASE 1 — SENSOR & LOG REALISM
Goal

Move from “sample data” to real sensor output.

Steps (In Order)

Install Snort on a test system or VM

Configure safe test rules (no risky payloads)

Generate benign lab traffic (loopback, test scans)

Produce real fast.log output

Validate parser against:

Real timestamps

Rule metadata

Edge cases (spacing, IPv6, odd flags)

Update tests to reflect real-world log variance

PHASE 2 — STREAMING INGEST (SOC REALITY)
Goal

Stop treating logs as files. Start treating them as event streams.

Steps

Implement log streaming:

stdin ingestion

File tailing (tail -F)

Convert parser into a generator-based pipeline

Process alerts continuously instead of batch mode

Add graceful shutdown + error handling

Week_2_Streaming_Detection_Pipeline

PHASE 3 — NORMALIZATION & ENRICHMENT
Goal

Make alerts SIEM-ready and analyst-friendly.

Steps

Define a normalized alert schema

Output alerts as JSONL

Add metadata:

Sensor name

Parser version

Ingest timestamp

Optional enrichment:

GeoIP (later)

Known-bad IP lists (offline)

Week_3_Normalized_Alert_Output

PHASE 4 — DEDUPLICATION & CORRELATION
Goal

Reduce noise and surface incidents, not spam.

Steps

Implement alert deduplication windows

Build correlation logic:

Port scans

Repeated signature hits

Multi-destination behavior

Group alerts into incidents

Assign severity scores

📸 Snapshot
Week_4_Alert_Correlation_Engine

PHASE 5 — SIEM INTEGRATION (ENTERPRISE SIGNAL)
Goal

Prove you understand enterprise telemetry pipelines.

Tools Introduced

Filebeat

Elasticsearch

Kibana
(Splunk optional later)

Steps

Ship JSONL alerts via Filebeat

Index into Elasticsearch

Build Kibana dashboards:

Alert volume

Top signatures

Source/destination heatmaps

Document detection logic clearly

📸 Snapshot
Week_5_SIEM_Integration_ELK

PHASE 6 — INCIDENT RESPONSE & SOAR HOOKS
Goal

Show readiness for automated response environments.

Steps

Add webhook output support

Trigger response actions:

Logging

Notifications

Case creation

Create mock SOAR playbooks

Emphasize human-in-the-loop controls

PHASE 7 — SECURITY HARDENING (MILITARY-GRADE SIGNAL)

“Military-grade” doesn’t mean secret — it means disciplined, auditable, and resilient.

Steps

Principle of least privilege

Secure config handling

Integrity checks on logs

Tamper detection

Clear audit trails

Threat model documentation

📸 Snapshot
Week_7_System_Hardening_and_Auditability

PHASE 8 — ADVERSARY THINKING & DETECTION ENGINEERING
Goal

Demonstrate threat hunter mindset.

Steps

Map detections to ATT&CK-style techniques

Write detection rationale

Simulate attacker behavior

Document false positives and tuning decisions

📸 Snapshot
Week_8_Detection_Engineering_and_Threat_Modeling

PHASE 9 — PRESENTATION & CAREER POSITIONING
Goal

Make this project impossible to ignore.

Steps

Final README (executive + technical)

Architecture diagrams

Detection philosophy section

“What this proves” section

Resume-ready bullet points

Interview walk-through narrative

About the Agencies You Mentioned

Let me be very clear and grounded here:

Agencies like National Security Agency, Department of Defense, and Central Intelligence Agency are not impressed by buzzwords.

They are impressed by:

Clean engineering

Strong documentation

Threat-aware thinking

Repeatable processes

Humility + rigor

Evidence of learning velocity

This roadmap builds exactly that signal.

How We’ll Work Together Going Forward

Daily: you log what you did

Weekly: we take a snapshot, summarize progress, and lock it

Anytime: if something feels unclear, we pause and explain why it exists

If you want, next we can:

Define Week 1’s exact checklist

Create a snapshot template

Or write the “Project Vision” section for your README

You’re building this the right way.
